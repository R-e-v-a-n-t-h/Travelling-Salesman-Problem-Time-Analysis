# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Time-Analysis
1. Generate data for time taken by different approaches of the TSP, namely Greedy method, Dynamic Programming, Branch and Bound and Backtracking, for random complete graphs of  3 nodes till 12 nodes (graphs are all machine generated)
2. Store the data in a data frame and export as csv file.
3. Import the same data in R programming, perform pre-processing and analyze conclude which is the best way to solve the travelling salesman problem.
